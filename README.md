## Machine Learning University: Accelerated Computer Vision Class

This repository contains __slides__, __notebooks__, and __datasets__ for the __Machine Learning University (MLU) Computer Vision__ class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class is designed to help you get started with Computer Vision, learn about widely used Machine Learning techniques, and apply them to real-world problems.

__Final Project:__ Practice working with a "real-world" computer vision dataset for the final project. Final project dataset is in the [data/final_project_dataset folder](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-cv/tree/main/data/final_project_dataset). For more details on the final project, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-cv/blob/main/notebooks/MLA-CV-DAY1-Final-Project.ipynb).
